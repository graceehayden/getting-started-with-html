  <h1>Welcome to <span>CODING</span></h1><br>
  <h2>(translated in a realtime alien language editor)</h2>
  
  <p>HTML is the text we read online, or, more fancily,
   hypertext markup language. </p>
   
  <p>This is an example of a paragraph tag. Tags are used
    to distinguish elements, or parts contained within the tags. 
    The 'em' tag, for instance, places emphasis on text by 
    <em>italicizing</em> it. The 'p' tag I've used separates the text 
    within it into... PARAGRAPHS.</p>
    
  <p>Computers need to be told what to do. They will misread
    all unedited typos and ruin code, lest you <b>change
    your ways</b>, Ebenezer. I promise to slow down and appreciate 
    the meaning in <del>Christmas</del> coding.</p>
    
  <p>This text editor finishing my closing tags for me is 
    surprisingly irritaing. Do people really <em>like</em>
    that?</p>
  
  <p>Block elements put themselves in blocks. Inline's don't. 
    Block elements are like Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada 
    and inline elements are all Anne Hathaway and totally clueless
    about style in comparison to Meryl, but they act
    act as if it doesn't matter, and while I bet they totally want
    to be apathetically cool too, they're just basic. omg.</p>
